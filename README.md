# Watermelon

Networking Freedom!

Allow serverhosting without network configuration, port fowarding, or VPN!
Clients can connect to the dedicated WatermelonServer for their traffic to be routed to the machine actually running the server. This is necessesary and posssible because joining a server as a client requires no special permisions on most networks and devices, yet hosting a server does. Watermelon can eliminate this issue.
